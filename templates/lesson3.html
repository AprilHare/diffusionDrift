<h1> Ok, but how can we describe this mathematically? </h1>
<hr>

<p>
In the last section, we showed how systems that evolve over time can be described by modeling the probability that the system is in a particular state at a given time. (This is mostly useful for systems that involve a large number of elements, like gases or populations.) In this section, we will show how this allows us to apply the mathematical tools developed for probability to describe these sorts of systems.

<p> 
First, our intuition for diffusion and drift can be captured in terms of features of the probability distribution. Diffusion spreads the distribution out, so it should scale with the rate of change of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"><em>variance</em></a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"><em>standard deviation</em></a> of the distribution. Drift moves the whole distribution, so it should correspond to changes in the average or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value"><em>mean</em></a> of the distribution.
