In evolutionary biology, in particular, in <abbr class="wikihover" rel="Population_genetics">population genetics</abbr>, we want to understand how genes are inhereted and passed on throughout the generations. Humans and nearly all other mammals are <abbr class="wikihover" rel="Ploidy">diploid</abbr>, they carry two copies of the genetic information. Every time two individuals mate they pass on one of the two copies of each gene to their offspring. The gametes are haploid cells: they only carry one of the two copies of each allele. Each of the <abbr class="wikihover" rel="Gamete">Gametes</abbr> contributes one copy of each allele to the offspring. <br/>
<br/>

	
As you know, in the real world the way genes are inherited depends on which individuals meet and mate in the first place. Factors such as individual mating preferences and geographic constraints influence this process. Thus the mating in a real population is not actually random. In science it is important to make abstractions to model and understand the basic underlying principles that guide natural processes. Let us examine the allele frequencies and genotype frequencies in an imaginary population. <figure>

We make a number of assumptions for this population: <br><br>
<ol type="1" style='margin-left: 56%'>
<li>the orgaisms are diploid</li>
<li>only sexual reproduction</li>
<li>generations do not overlap</li>
<li>mating is random</li>
<li>population size is very large (N = âˆž)</li>
<li>allele frequencies are equal in the sexes</li>
<li>abscence of migration, mutation or selection</li>
</ol>

The figure describes the propagation of allele frequencies in a Hardy-Weinberg population of <abbr class="wikihover" rel="peppered moth">peppered moth</abbr>. These moth carry two alleles that determine their color. The dominant alle <i>A</i>, is associated with a dark phenotype and the recessive alle <i>a</i>,  is associated with a lighter phenotype. To calculate the allele frequency in the population, we simply count the number of <abbr class="wikihover" rel="Zygosity">homozygotes and heterozygotes</abbr>. You obtain the allele frequency for a given allele in this diploid population by adding the number of homozygotes for that allele plus half of the number of heterozygotes and divide by the total number of individuals. The genotype frequencies in the second generation are obtained by multiplying the respective allele frequencies, which models all possible combinations of gametes that can occur in fertilization. As depicted in the figure the Genotype frequency for <i>AA</i>, <i>Aa</i> and <i>aa</i> changes to 0.3025, 2 x 0.2475 and 0.2025. However, the allele frequencies remain the same: P(A) = 0.3025 + 0.2475 = 0.55 and P(a) = 0.2025 + 0.2475 = 0.45. Thus in a population that fulfills the above assumptions the allele frequencies do not change. This is called the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium. Since real populaitons never fulfill all of the above assumptions, allele frequencies do change in reality. Let's now explore a model that is capbale to describe allele frequencies in real populations. <a href="/lesson5"> >> Lesson 5
